    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.
        The virus is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.
        Public health groups, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO, are monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and posting updates on their websites. These groups have also issued recommendations for preventing and treating the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p> Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. You can still spread COVID-19 before you have symptoms (presymptomatic transmission). Common signs and symptoms can include:
        • Fever
        • Cough
        • Tiredness
    Early symptoms of COVID-19 may include a loss of taste or smell.
    Other symptoms can include:
        • Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
        • Muscle aches
        • Chills
        • Sore throat
        • Runny nose
        • Headache
        • Chest pain
        • Pink eye (conjunctivitis)
        • Nausea
        • Vomiting
        • Diarrhea
        • Rash
    This list isn't complete. Children have similar symptoms to adults and generally have mild illness.
    The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have only a few symptoms. Some people may have no symptoms at all, but can still spread it (asymptomatic transmission). Some people may experience worsened symptoms, such as worsened shortness of breath and pneumonia, about a week after symptoms start.
    Some people experience COVID-19 symptoms for more than four weeks after they're diagnosed. These health issues are sometimes called post-COVID-19 conditions. Some children experience multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a syndrome that can affect some organs and tissues, several weeks after having COVID-19. Rarely, some adults experience the syndrome too.
    People who are older have a higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, and the risk increases with age. People who have existing medical conditions also may have a higher risk of serious illness. <br>Certain medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious illness from COVID-19 include:
        • Serious heart diseases, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy
        • Cancer
        • Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
        • Type 1 or type 2 diabetes
        • Overweight, obesity or severe obesity
        • High blood pressure
        • Smoking
        • Chronic kidney disease
        • Sickle cell disease or thalassemia
        • Weakened immune system from solid organ transplants or bone marrow transplants
        • Pregnancy
        • Asthma
        • Chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension
        • Liver disease
        • Dementia
        • Down syndrome
        • Weakened immune system from bone marrow transplant, HIV or some medications
        • Brain and nervous system conditions, such as strokes
        • Substance use disorders
    This list is not complete. Other medical conditions may increase your risk of serious illness from COVID-19.
